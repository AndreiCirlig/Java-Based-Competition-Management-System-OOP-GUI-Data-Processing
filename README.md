# Java-Based-Competition-Management-System-OOP-GUI-Data-Processing
As part of my Software Development coursework, I developed a Java-based Competition Management System that allows competitors to register, compete, and track results, while ensuring secure access for staff and officials. This project combined Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data persistence, GUI design, and algorithm development to create a fully functional competition tracking system.

ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
âœ… Competitor Registration & Data Validation

Implemented form-based competitor registration with input validation for age, category, and duplicate entries.
Used custom exception handling to ensure error-free data entry.
âœ… Competition Scoring & Reports

Designed a flexible scoring system allowing staff to input scores and automatically calculate overall scores using different methods (weighted averages, top-n scores, and outlier exclusion).
Generated real-time reports displaying competitors' performance and ranking.
âœ… Data Persistence & File Handling

Used JSON & CSV files for persistent storage, ensuring that all data could be analyzed after the event.
Implemented file I/O operations to read, update, and write competitor data efficiently.
âœ… Object-Oriented Design & Inheritance

Applied OOP principles, creating Competitor subclasses for different competition levels.
Utilized abstract classes and method overriding for structured data management.
âœ… GUI Development (MVC Pattern)

Designed an interactive GUI for managing competitors, scores, and event summaries.
Implemented search and filter functionalities to view competitors by category, scores, or performance history.
Used Java Swing for a clean and user-friendly interface.
